need a CSV file showing each tag seen (in the entire record), and what GPS coordinates it was seen at and the signal strength at that location.

from the example file:

name				
TAG13372	44.854	-109.73484	 -112dBm	
	44.863	-109.75818	 -112dBm	
	44.87115	-109.76333	 -83dBm	
	44.88186	-109.76728	 -13dBm	
	44.88721	-109.78307	 -43dBm	
	44.87918	-109.7987	 -13dBm	
				
TAG18554	44.863	-109.75818	 -16dBm	
				
TAG17433	44.863	-109.75818	 -48dBm	
	44.87115	-109.76333	 -82dBm
